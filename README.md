# AIT690-Assignment2

This Python program called ngram.py will learn an N-gram language model from an arbitrary number of plain text files. The program can generate a given number of sentences based on that N-gram model. 

This program can work for any value of N, and output m sentences as the user requires. Your can run the program as follows:

   ngram.py n m input-file/s
   
n refers to the number of grams and m refers to the number of sentences you want to generate.

for example:
   ngram.pl 3 10 pg2554.txt pg2600.txt pg1399.txt
   
   
The .txt files used in this project are from <http://www.gutenberg.org>. Thus, you could chose the files name as follows:

   'austen-emma.txt', 'austen-persuasion.txt', 'austen-sense.txt', 'bible-kjv.txt', 'blake-poems.txt', 'bryant-stories.txt',  
   'burgess-  busterbrown.txt', 'carroll-alice.txt', 'chesterton-ball.txt', 'chesterton-brown.txt', 'chesterton-thursday.txt',  
   'edgeworth-parents.txt', 'melville-moby_dick.txt', 'milton-paradise.txt', 'shakespeare-caesar.txt', 
   'shakespeare-hamlet.txt',   'shakespeare-macbeth.txt', 'whitman-leaves.txt'
